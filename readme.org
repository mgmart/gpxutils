#+TITLE: GPS Track Utilites

* GPS Track Utilities

This project was initiated because I needed a tools which extracts all tracks
from a multi-track GPX file.

At the moment this is besides the possibility to list all tracks within a file
the only implemented function.

Possible additions to this project could be reading and writing of /fit/ files.

** Usage

Show all possible command line arguments
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
gpxutils -h
#+END_SRC

List all tracks (by timestamp) within a multi-track GPX file
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
gpxutils -in [gpxfile] ls
#+END_SRC

Extract all tracks to single files from multi-track GPX file
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
gpxutils -in [gpxfile] -out [folder to write to] -split
#+END_SRC
