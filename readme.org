* GPS Track Utilities

This project was initiated because I needed to extract all tracks from a
multi-track GPX file. In an update the addition of timestamps to waypoints was added.

At the moment this is - besides the possibility to list all tracks within a file
- the only implemented function.

Possible additions to this project could be reading and writing of /fit/ files.

** Usage

Show all possible command line arguments
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
gpxutils -h
#+END_SRC

List all tracks (by timestamp) within a multi-track GPX file
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
gpxutils -in [gpxfile] ls
#+END_SRC

Extract all tracks to single files from multi-track GPX file
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
gpxutils -in [gpxfile] -out [folder to write to] -split
#+END_SRC

Add timestamps to an existing gpx.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
gpxutils -in [gpxfile] -time -begin [hh:mm] -end [hh:mm]
#+END_SRC
